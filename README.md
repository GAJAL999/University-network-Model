Campus Infrastructure:
1. Main Campus:
a. Building A: it has administrative staff (HR Finance), Art & Design faculty. All connected through VLAN Network.
b. Building B: has faculty of Engineering and Computer. Faculty of Business.
c. Building C: it has Student labs and IT department. IT dept. host university web server & other Email server.
Also, an email severs hosted extremely on the cloud.
2. Smaller Campus: -
It has faculty of Health and Sciences
Configure core devices and few end devices to provide end-to-end connectivity and access internal & external servers.
1. Each department is expected to be on its own separate IP Network.
2. Switches configured with appropriate VLAN's and security settings.
3. RIPV2 will be used to provide routing for routers for server.
4. Devices in Building A will be expected to acquire dynamic IP addresses from a router based DHCP Server.

DATA SECURITY RISKS:
Unauthorised access to or loss of sensitive data.
Countermeasures:
1. Implement Data Loss Prevention solutions to monitor and protect data.
2. Regularly back up data and have a recovery plan in place.
3. Classify data to identify and prioritize protection of sensitive information.

HUMAN FACTOR RISKS:
Human errors and social engineering attacks.
Countermeasures:
1. Run phishing simulations to test and improve awareness.
2. Develop and communicate clear incident response plans.
3. Provide easy-to-use reporting mechanisms for suspected security incidents.

NETWORK SECURITY RISKS:
Unauthorised access to the campus network and data breaches.
Countermeasures:
1. Deploy robust firewalls and IDS to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
2. Use encryption protocols for data transmission and storage.
3. Implement strict access controls and multi-factor authentication for network access.

ENDPOINT SECURITY RISKS:
Compromise of devices such as computers, smartphones and IoT devices.
Countermeasures:
1. Ensure all devices have up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware software installed.
2. Encrypt data stored on-all devices.
3. Implement Mobile Device Management solutions to manage and secure mobile devices.
